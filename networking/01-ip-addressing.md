## IP Addressing

## Learning Goals:

- Understand the fundamentals of IP addressing (IPv4, IPv6)
- Learn about subnetting, subnet masks, and private/public IP ranges

## What is an IP address?

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol. It works like a postal address, telling data packets where to go and where they came from. There are two main versions: IPv4 (192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (like 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334). IP addresses can be public (used on the internet) or private (used in local networks like your home).

## What is subnetting?

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets). It helps improve network performance and security by isolating traffic and limiting broadcast domains.

**Why it matters:**

- Makes large networks more efficient
- Enhances security by separating devices into isolated zones
- Helps manage IP address allocation more precisely

## What is a subnet mask?

A subnet mask is a number that defines which part of an IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host (the specific device).
