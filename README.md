## Python - Linux - Networking
---

This repository is where I will be tracking my learning journey with Python, Linux and Networking. It will be a combination of theory, practice and small projects to reinforce learning. If a project becomes particularly interesting it might get its own repository to concentrate more on it, but let's see how things progress.

I will try and update the log daily to track my progress and document any exciting news or projects that I am working on.
