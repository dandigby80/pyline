## Variables and Data Types

## Learning Goals:

- Understand basic data types in Python
- Learn how to create variables and assign values

## What are 'Data Types' and what types does Python have?

A data type is a classification that tells the computer what kind of value you're working with and what operations can be performed on it. For example:

- `'hello'` is a **string** (text data)
- `42` is an **integer** (whole number)
- `[1,2,3]` is a **list** (a collection of items)
- `{"key": "value"}` is a **dictionary** (a set of key-value pairs)
- `True` is a **boolean** (true/false logic)

Python has the following data types built in:

- Text Type:		`str`
- Numeric Types:	`int`, `float`, `complex`
- Sequence Types:	`list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping Types:	`dict`
- Set Types:		`set`, `frozenset`
- Boolean Type:		`bool`
- Binary Types:		`bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
- None Type:		`NoneType`

Lets look at 'text type', 'sequence types', 'mapping types' and 'set types':
