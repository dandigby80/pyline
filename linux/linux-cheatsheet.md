# Linux Commands and Operations Cheat Sheet

This is in no particular order, I will just add to it as I come across commands and useful things to refer back to quickly.

**pwd** - print working directory: prints the full path of the current working directory

`[me@linuxprompt ~]$ pwd`

**ls** - list (or list storage): lists all the files and directories in the current working directory

`[me@linuxprompt ~]$ ls`

**cd** - change directory: This command allows us to move into other directories

`[me@linuxprompt ~]$ cd 'another/directory`
